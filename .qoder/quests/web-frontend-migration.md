# Web Frontend Migration Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the specification for migrating the HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend from ATLAS.BC0.0.1/web/frontend to a Flutter implementation within the GOFLUTTER project structure, maintaining feature parity while leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### ATLAS.BC0.0.1/web/frontend
The current web frontend consists of:
- 14 HTML pages covering core blockchain functionality
- Common JavaScript utilities (common.js, main.js)
- Feature areas: Intro, Wallet, Wallet Setup, Explorer, DeFi, Governance, Identity, Social, Contracts, Health, Node Dashboard

### GOFLUTTER Structure
The target Flutter project follows:
- Feature-first organization with clean architecture
- Separation of data, domain, and presentation layers
- Core infrastructure modules (api, network, routing, storage)
- Shared components and themes

### Already Implemented Features
Several features have already been partially or fully implemented in GOFLUTTER:
- Intro page with carousel and feature cards
- Wallet setup with create/import functionality
- Basic wallet functionality with send/receive pages
- Routing for all major features
- Core BLoC state management for features
- Data models and repository patterns

However, many features still need enhancement to match the full functionality of the HTML implementation.

## Migration Status

Based on analysis of the current GOFLUTTER project, the following features have been implemented:

| HTML File | Flutter Feature Module | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| index.html | features/dashboard | Partially implemented | Main navigation hub with feature cards |
| intro.html | features/intro | Partially implemented | Onboarding carousel and feature overview |
| wallet.html | features/wallet | Partially implemented | Basic wallet functionality |
| wallet-setup.html | features/wallet_setup | Partially implemented | Wallet creation/import flow |
| explorer.html | features/explorer | To implement | Blockchain explorer |
| defi.html | features/defi | To implement | DeFi platform interface |
| governance.html | features/governance | To implement | Governance and voting system |
| identity.html | features/identity | To implement | Identity management |
| social.html | features/social | To implement | Social platform |
| contracts.html | features/contracts | To implement | Smart contract interface |
| health.html | features/health | To implement | System health monitoring |
| node-dashboard.html | features/node_dashboard | To implement | Node management dashboard |

## GOFLUTTER Run Status

After analyzing the GOFLUTTER project structure and codebase, I've identified the following issues that need to be resolved to ensure the app can run properly:

1. **Missing Font Assets**: The app references Inter font family but the font files are missing from the assets directory. However, the pubspec.yaml does not contain font declarations, so this may not be an issue.
2. **Incomplete Feature Implementation**: Most features beyond basic wallet functionality are not fully implemented.
3. **API Integration**: The app has basic API client structure but needs full implementation of endpoints.
4. **Cryptography Implementation**: Wallet signing functionality needs to be implemented using Flutter-compatible libraries.
5. **JavaScript Functionality Migration**: Many functions from common.js and main.js need to be ported to Dart.

## Required Actions to Complete Migration and Ensure GOFLUTTER Runs

### 1. Fix Asset Issues

1. **Font Assets**:
   - Option A: Add the missing Inter font files to the `assets/fonts/` directory
   - Option B: Modify the theme to use system fonts instead by setting `fontFamily` to null in text styles

## Immediate Steps to Get GOFLUTTER Running

To quickly get the GOFLUTTER app running with minimal functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Check Font Configuration**:
   - Review `pubspec.yaml` to see if there are font declarations
   - The current pubspec.yaml does not contain font declarations, so this is not an issue

2. **Verify Dependencies**:
   - Run `flutter pub get` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed

3. **Test Basic Run**:
   - Run `flutter run` to see if the app starts
   - If there are issues, check the debug console for specific error messages

4. **Current Implementation Status**:
   - Based on code analysis, the following features should work:
     - Dashboard navigation
     - Basic wallet functionality
     - Intro page
     - Wallet setup
   - The following features are not yet implemented:
     - Explorer
     - DeFi
     - Governance
     - Identity
     - Social
     - Contracts
     - Health
     - Node Dashboard

5. **Fix Critical Issues**:
   - Address any compilation errors that appear
   - Ensure all imported files exist and are properly referenced

## Conclusion
This specification provides a comprehensive roadmap for migrating the ATLAS.BC0.0.1 web frontend to the GOFLUTTER Flutter project. By following the feature-first organization and clean architecture principles already established in GOFLUTTER, we can systematically convert each HTML component to its Flutter equivalent while maintaining full functionality and improving the user experience.

## Next Steps

2. **Short-term Goals** (1-2 weeks):
   - Complete implementation of core features (Explorer, DeFi, Governance)
   - Implement API integration for all endpoints
   - Add cryptographic functionality for wallet operations
   - Port JavaScript functions to Dart

3. **Medium-term Goals** (2-4 weeks):
   - Implement remaining features (Identity, Social, Contracts, Health, Node Dashboard)
   - Add comprehensive testing (unit, widget, integration)
   - Optimize performance and fix bugs
   - Implement real-time data fetching and auto-refresh

4. **Long-term Goals** (1-2 months):
   - Add advanced features like push notifications, biometric authentication
   - Implement offline mode
   - Add deep linking
   - Complete documentation and user guides

With these steps, the GOFLUTTER app will provide full feature parity with the original web frontend while leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.
