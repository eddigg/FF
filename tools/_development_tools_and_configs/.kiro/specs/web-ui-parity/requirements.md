# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to achieve complete UI/UX parity between the existing web frontend (ATLAS.BC0.0.1/web/frontend) and the Flutter application (GOFLUTTER). The goal is to replicate the sophisticated design, layout, navigation patterns, and visual elements from the web version into the Flutter app, ensuring users have an identical experience regardless of platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user switching between web and Flutter versions, I want the main dashboard to look and feel identical, so that I have a consistent experience across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Flutter app THEN the dashboard SHALL display the same navigation card grid layout as the web version
2. WHEN the user views the dashboard THEN it SHALL include the same header with "ðŸ”— ATLAS B.C." title and subtitle
3. WHEN the user sees the navigation cards THEN they SHALL have identical icons, titles, descriptions, and button styles as the web version
4. WHEN the user views the dashboard THEN it SHALL include the same node status indicator and port selection functionality
5. WHEN the user interacts with navigation cards THEN they SHALL have the same hover effects and animations as the web version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the network architecture section to be identical in Flutter, so that I can access the same network information in both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the dashboard THEN it SHALL display the network architecture card section below the navigation grid
2. WHEN the network architecture loads THEN it SHALL show the same 5 cards: Node Types, P2P Protocol, Consensus Mechanism, Network Topology, and Security Features
3. WHEN the architecture data is fetched THEN it SHALL display the same real-time information as the web version
4. WHEN the user hovers over architecture cards THEN they SHALL have the same visual feedback as the web version
5. WHEN there are API errors THEN the cards SHALL display the same error states as the web version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the visual styling and theming to match exactly, so that the Flutter app feels like the same application as the web version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views any screen THEN it SHALL use the same color scheme, gradients, and background patterns as the web version
2. WHEN the user sees text elements THEN they SHALL use the same Inter font family, sizes, and weights as the web version
3. WHEN the user views cards and containers THEN they SHALL have the same border radius, shadows, and backdrop blur effects
4. WHEN the user interacts with buttons THEN they SHALL have the same styling, gradients, and hover animations
5. WHEN the user views the layout THEN it SHALL have the same spacing, padding, and responsive behavior as the web version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation and routing to work identically, so that I can navigate between features in the same way on both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks navigation cards THEN they SHALL navigate to the same routes as the web version
2. WHEN the user accesses individual feature pages THEN they SHALL have the same layout and functionality as web counterparts
3. WHEN the user uses the logout functionality THEN it SHALL work the same way as the web version
4. WHEN the user switches between node ports THEN the functionality SHALL work identically to the web version
5. WHEN the user navigates back to dashboard THEN they SHALL see the same updated state as the web version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same interactive features and real-time updates, so that the Flutter app provides the same functionality as the web version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL fetch and display the same real-time data as the web version
2. WHEN the user switches node ports THEN the app SHALL update all data sources identically to the web version
3. WHEN the app refreshes data THEN it SHALL use the same refresh intervals and patterns as the web version
4. WHEN the user sees loading states THEN they SHALL match the web version's loading indicators
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the error handling and display SHALL match the web version's behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive design that works on different screen sizes, so that the Flutter app adapts to various devices like the web version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the app on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt using the same responsive breakpoints as the web version
2. WHEN the screen is mobile-sized THEN the navigation cards SHALL stack in a single column like the web version
3. WHEN the screen is tablet-sized THEN the grid SHALL show 2 columns like the web version
4. WHEN the screen is desktop-sized THEN the grid SHALL show 4 columns like the web version
5. WHEN the layout changes THEN all spacing and sizing SHALL match the web version's responsive behavior
