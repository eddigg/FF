# GOFLUTTER Enhancement Specifications to Match Web Frontend Capabilities

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications needed to enhance the GOFLUTTER application to match the capabilities and features of the web frontend. The goal is to ensure feature parity between the Flutter mobile application and the web interface, providing users with a consistent experience across platforms.

## Repository Type Detection

The project is a **Mobile Application** built with Flutter, integrating with a blockchain backend. It contains both the core Flutter application structure and integration with Firebase for authentication.

## Architecture Overview

### Current GOFLUTTER Architecture
- Flutter mobile application using Provider and BLoC state management

- Web3Dart for blockchain interactions
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Feature-based folder structure

### Web Frontend Architecture
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- Direct API calls to backend services
- Wallet management with local cryptographic operations
- Comprehensive dashboard with multiple modules (Wallet, Explorer, DeFi, Governance, etc.)

## Feature Gap Analysis
