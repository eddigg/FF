# Migration Guide: Java/HTML to Flutter

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for migrating the existing Java/HTML wallet implementation to Flutter. The migration will enable a cross-platform mobile and web experience while maintaining all existing functionality and security requirements.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup and Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Run the provided setup scripts:
     - Windows: `setup_flutter_environment.bat`
     - macOS/Linux: `setup_flutter_environment.sh`
   - Configure Firebase project to match existing authentication settings
   - Set up environment variables in `.env` file

2. **Project Structure Initialization**
   - Run the provided initialization scripts:
     - Windows: `initialize_project_structure.bat`
     - macOS/Linux: `initialize_project_structure.sh`
   - This will create the recommended Flutter project structure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Implement Firebase authentication (see `auth_service_implementation.dart`)
   - Ensure user registration creates wallet automatically
   - Maintain session management similar to existing implementation

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Implement secure storage for wallet credentials (see `secure_storage_implementation.dart`)
   - Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Ensure private keys are never exposed in plaintext

3. **API Client**
   - Implement API client for ATLAS.BC backend (see `api_client_implementation.dart`)
   - Maintain all existing endpoints and functionality
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

4. **Wallet Service**
   - Implement wallet service (see `wallet_service_implementation.dart`)
   - Support all existing wallet operations
   - Ensure transaction signing is performed client-side

### Phase 3: UI Implementation

1. **Authentication Screens**
   - Implement login and registration screens (see `auth_screens_implementation.dart`)
   - Match existing UX flow and validation rules

2. **Wallet Screens**
   - Implement wallet dashboard (see `wallet_screens_implementation.dart`)
   - Display balance, transaction history, and wallet details
   - Implement send transaction functionality
   - Implement faucet request functionality

3. **Main Application**
   - Implement main application structure (see `main_app_implementation.dart`)
   - Set up navigation and routing
   - Configure dependency injection

## Code Migration Reference

### Java/HTML to Flutter Mapping

| Java/HTML Component | Flutter Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Servlet Controllers | API Client | Flutter uses Dio for HTTP requests |
| JSP Views | Flutter Widgets | UI components are declarative in Flutter |
| Java Models | Dart Classes | Similar structure, but with Dart syntax |
| JDBC Database Access | Firebase/Firestore | Cloud-based database with real-time updates |
| Session Management | Firebase Auth | Token-based authentication |
| LocalStorage | Flutter Secure Storage | Enhanced security for sensitive data |
| JavaScript Functions | Dart Methods | Similar functionality with Dart syntax |

### Authentication Flow Comparison

**Existing Java/HTML Flow:**
```
User Input → Form Submission → Servlet Controller → Database Validation → Session Creation → Redirect
```

**New Flutter Flow:**
```
User Input → Form Validation → Firebase Auth API → Token Generation → Secure Storage → Navigation
```

### Wallet Operations Comparison

**Existing Java/HTML Flow:**
```
User Action → JavaScript → AJAX Request → Servlet Controller → Backend API → Response Handling → DOM Update
```

**New Flutter Flow:**
```
User Action → Widget Event → Service Call → API Client → Backend API → State Update → UI Rebuild
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each service in isolation
   - Mock API responses and dependencies
   - Verify correct behavior for success and error cases

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - Test wallet operations with mock backend
   - Verify proper state management and UI updates

3. **Security Testing**
   - Verify secure storage implementation
   - Test for potential vulnerabilities
   - Ensure private keys are properly protected

## Rollout Plan

1. **Alpha Testing**
   - Internal testing with development team
   - Fix critical issues and bugs

2. **Beta Testing**
   - Limited user testing
   - Gather feedback and make improvements

3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Release to small percentage of users
   - Monitor performance and issues
   - Gradually increase rollout percentage

4. **Full Deployment**
   - Complete migration for all users
   - Maintain legacy system temporarily as fallback
   - Monitor and address any issues

## Conclusion

This migration guide provides a structured approach to transitioning from the existing Java/HTML implementation to a modern Flutter application. By following the outlined phases and leveraging the provided implementation files, the migration can be completed efficiently while maintaining all existing functionality and security requirements.
