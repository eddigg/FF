# Flutter Wallet Integration Deployment Plan

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Flutter-based wallet integration for ATLAS.BC. It provides a structured approach to ensure a smooth transition from development to production.

## 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly configured in `.env` file
- [ ] Ensure Firebase project is set up for production environment
- [ ] Configure proper API endpoints for production
- [ ] Set up proper SSL certificates for secure API communication

### Code Quality and Testing
- [ ] Complete all unit tests with >90% code coverage
- [ ] Run integration tests in staging environment
- [ ] Perform security audit on wallet implementation
- [ ] Conduct UI/UX testing on all wallet screens
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes and orientations
- [ ] Verify proper error handling and recovery

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Run performance profiling on wallet operations
- [ ] Optimize asset loading and rendering
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Verify memory usage patterns

## 2. Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)
1. Deploy to internal testing environment
2. Distribute to development team for dogfooding
3. Collect and address feedback
4. Fix critical issues identified during internal testing

### Phase 2: Beta Testing (Week 2-3)
1. Deploy to beta testing environment
2. Distribute to selected beta testers
3. Monitor usage patterns and collect feedback
4. Address issues and implement improvements
5. Conduct security penetration testing

### Phase 3: Production Rollout (Week 4)
1. Prepare production environment
2. Configure monitoring and alerting systems
3. Deploy to production with feature flags
4. Implement phased rollout strategy (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
5. Monitor for issues and be prepared for rollback if necessary

## 3. Deployment Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for Flutter deployment
name: Flutter Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.10.0'
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter test
      - run: flutter build apk --release
      - run: flutter build web --release
      - name: Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: app-release
          path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
      - name: Upload Web
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: web-release
          path: build/web
```

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting
- Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Configure custom analytics events for wallet operations
- Create dashboard for monitoring wallet usage and performance

## 4. Post-Deployment Activities

### User Support
- Prepare documentation for end users
- Set up support channels for wallet-related issues
- Train customer support team on wallet functionality

### Maintenance Plan
- Schedule regular security updates
- Plan for periodic dependency updates
- Establish process for addressing critical vulnerabilities

### Continuous Improvement
- Collect user feedback through in-app mechanisms
- Analyze usage patterns to identify improvement areas
- Plan feature roadmap based on user needs and business goals

## 5. Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Monitor error rates and user reports
   - Determine severity and impact

2. **Decision to Rollback**
   - If issue affects core wallet functionality or security
   - If issue impacts more than 5% of users
   - If workaround is not immediately available

3. **Rollback Process**
   - Disable new version via feature flags if possible
   - Revert to previous stable version
   - Notify users of temporary downtime if necessary
   - Deploy previous version

4. **Communication**
   - Inform stakeholders about the issue and rollback
   - Provide estimated timeline for fix
   - Update users through appropriate channels

## 6. Release Notes Template
