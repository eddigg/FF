# Ends Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the `cercaend` Flutter application with the `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1` blockchain backend.

## 1. Discovery and Analysis

*   **Objective:** Thoroughly understand both the `cercaend` and `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1` codebases.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Read `cercaend/lib/mainpages/userpage.dart` to understand the entry point for the wallet feature.
    *   Analyze `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1/web/frontend/wallet.html` to understand the target UI and functionality.
    *   Review `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` and `WALLET_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` for existing integration strategies.
    *   Examine `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1`'s Go code to understand the blockchain's data structures and API endpoints.

## 2. Wallet UI in `cercaend`

*   **Objective:** Create a new "Wallet" tab in `cercaend` that is accessible from the `userpage`.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Modify `cercaend/lib/mainpages/userpage.dart` to add a "Wallet" choice chip.
    *   Create a new widget for the Wallet view, initially populated with mock data.
    *   The UI will be inspired by `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1/web/frontend/wallet.html` and the existing `creditCard` component in `cercaend`.

## 3. Mock Blockchain API

*   **Objective:** Simulate the ATLAS blockchain backend to enable frontend development without a live blockchain.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Define a clear API contract based on the functionalities required by the `cercaend` wallet UI.
    *   Create a mock server or a set of mock data files that respond to API requests.
    *   The mock data will mirror the data structures used in `ATLAS.BC 0.0.1`.

## 4. Integration and Feature Implementation

*   **Objective:** Connect the `cercaend` wallet UI to the mock API and implement core wallet features.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Fetch and display wallet balance and transaction history from the mock API.
    *   Implement "Request Token" and "Make Transaction" functionalities. These will interact with the mock API.
    *   Ensure the UI provides clear feedback to the user for all actions.

## 5. Testing

*   **Objective:** Verify the functionality of the integrated components.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Create unit tests for the new UI components and the mock API client.
    *   Perform manual end-to-end testing of the wallet feature in the `cercaend` app.

This plan will be executed iteratively, with constant feedback and adjustments. The initial focus is on creating a robust and functional MVP.
