# Version Compatibility Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the version compatibility requirements to ensure that the Flutter implementation matches the web version exactly. Following these guidelines will minimize the chance of errors during migration from Java/HTML to Flutter.

## Flutter SDK Version

```
flutter: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"
```

Ensure you are using Flutter 3.x for this project. This version range provides the best stability and feature compatibility with the web implementation.

## Package Versions

The following package versions have been carefully selected to match the functionality of the web version:

### Core Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.5
  firebase_core: ^2.15.1
  firebase_auth: ^4.9.0
  cloud_firestore: ^4.9.1
  flutter_secure_storage: ^8.0.0
  dio: ^5.3.2
  get_it: ^7.6.0
  web3dart: ^2.7.1
  http: ^1.1.0
  provider: ^6.0.5
  intl: ^0.18.1
```

### Development Dependencies

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.2
  mockito: ^5.4.2
  build_runner: ^2.4.6
```

## API Compatibility

To ensure exact compatibility with the web version, the Flutter implementation must:

1. Use the same API endpoints with identical request/response formats
2. Maintain the same authentication flow
3. Use the same wallet creation and transaction signing mechanisms

### API Endpoints

The following endpoints must be implemented with the exact same request and response formats:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Request Format | Response Format |
|----------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| `/wallet/create` | Create new wallet | `{}` | `{"address": "0x...", "privateKey": "0x...", "sessionToken": "..."}` |
| `/wallet/import` | Import existing wallet | `{"privateKey": "0x..."}` | `{"address": "0x...", "privateKey": "0x...", "sessionToken": "..."}` |
| `/wallet/:address` | Get wallet info | N/A | `{"address": "0x...", "balance": 0.0, "nonce": 0, "recentTransactions": [...]}` |
| `/faucet/request` | Request test tokens | `{"address": "0x..."}` | `{"message": "Tokens credited successfully"}` |
| `/transaction/send` | Send transaction | `{"signedTransaction": "0x...", "to": "0x..."}` | `{"transactionHash": "0x..."}` |

## Data Model Compatibility

The data models in Flutter must match the web version exactly. The following models have been implemented:

1. `User` - User profile information
2. `Wallet` - Wallet information including balance and transactions
3. `WalletResponse` - Response from wallet creation/import
4. `Transaction` - Transaction details

## UI/UX Compatibility

The Flutter UI should match the web version in terms of:

1. Screen flow and navigation
2. Form validation rules
3. Error handling and user feedback
4. Visual design and branding

## Testing for Compatibility

To ensure compatibility between Flutter and web versions:

1. Run the same test cases on both platforms
2. Verify API requests and responses match exactly
3. Compare wallet creation, import, and transaction signing results
4. Validate user flows and error handling

## Version Control Strategy

To maintain version compatibility:

1. Use semantic versioning for both web and Flutter implementations
2. Document any divergence between platforms
3. Maintain a changelog of updates to both platforms
4. Ensure API changes are implemented simultaneously on both platforms

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

### Firebase Authentication

Ensure Firebase projects are configured identically for web and Flutter:

```
firebase_core: ^2.15.1
firebase_auth: ^4.9.0
cloud_firestore: ^4.9.1
```

### Wallet Integration

Ensure the same wallet creation and transaction signing mechanisms:

```
web3dart: ^2.7.1
flutter_secure_storage: ^8.0.0
```

### Network Requests

Use the same HTTP client configuration:

```
dio: ^5.3.2
http: ^1.1.0
```

## Conclusion

By following this version compatibility guide, you can ensure that the Flutter implementation matches the web version exactly, minimizing the chance of errors during migration from Java/HTML to Flutter.
