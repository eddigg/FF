# Web Frontend Migration Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the specification for migrating the HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend from ATLAS.BC0.0.1/web/frontend to a Flutter implementation within the GOFLUTTER project structure, maintaining feature parity while leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### ATLAS.BC0.0.1/web/frontend
The current web frontend consists of:
- 14 HTML pages covering core blockchain functionality
- Common JavaScript utilities (common.js, main.js)
- Feature areas: Intro, Wallet, Wallet Setup, Explorer, DeFi, Governance, Identity, Social, Contracts, Health, Node Dashboard

### GOFLUTTER Structure
The target Flutter project follows:
- Feature-first organization with clean architecture
- Separation of data, domain, and presentation layers
- Core infrastructure modules (api, network, routing, storage)
- Shared components and themes

### Already Implemented Features
Several features have already been partially or fully implemented in GOFLUTTER:
- Intro page with carousel and feature cards
- Wallet setup with create/import functionality
- Basic wallet functionality with send/receive pages
- Routing for all major features
- Core BLoC state management for features
- Data models and repository patterns

However, many features still need enhancement to match the full functionality of the HTML implementation.

## Migration Specification

### 1. Feature Mapping
Each HTML page will be converted to a corresponding Flutter feature module:

| HTML File | Flutter Feature Module | Status |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| index.html | features/dashboard | Partially implemented |
| intro.html | features/intro | Partially implemented |
| wallet.html | features/wallet | Partially implemented |
| wallet-setup.html | features/wallet_setup | Partially implemented |
| explorer.html | features/explorer | To implement |
| defi.html | features/defi | To implement |
| governance.html | features/governance | To implement |
| identity.html | features/identity | To implement |
| social.html | features/social | To implement |
| contracts.html | features/contracts | To implement |
| health.html | features/health | To implement |
| node-dashboard.html | features/node_dashboard | To implement |

Note: Some features already have basic implementations but require enhancement to match the full HTML functionality.

### 2. Implementation Approach

#### 2.1 Clean Architecture Layers
Each feature module will implement three layers:
- **Presentation**: UI components (widgets, pages, blocs)
- **Domain**: Business logic entities and repository interfaces
- **Data**: Repository implementations and data sources

#### 2.2 Data Models
Implement the following data models based on the HTML functionality:
- Block model with index, hash, timestamp, and transaction data
- Transaction model with sender, recipient, amount, fee, and signature
- Wallet model with address, balance, and transaction history
- Node model with status, port, and peer information
- Proposal model for governance features
- Contract model for smart contract functionality
- User profile model for identity management
- Post/comment models for social features
- Health metrics model for system monitoring

#### 2.7 State Management
- Use BLoC pattern for state management as indicated in the GOFLUTTER structure
- Implement feature-specific blocs in each module's presentation/bloc directory

#### 2.3 API Integration
- Utilize existing core/api services for backend communication
- Extend blockchain_api_service.dart as needed for new endpoints

- `/balance` endpoint for wallet balance retrieval
- `/mempool` endpoint for recent transactions
- `/peers` endpoint for network peer information
- `/blocks` endpoint for blockchain data
- `/validator` endpoint for validator information
- `/submit-transaction` endpoint for transaction submission
- Additional endpoints for DeFi, governance, identity, social, contracts, and health features

#### 2.8 JavaScript Functionality Migration
Convert the following JavaScript functionality from common.js and main.js to Dart services:
- Wallet generation and management functions
- Cryptographic signing functionality for transactions
- DER to RS signature conversion
- Array buffer to hex conversion
- Wallet address export and display
- Transaction signing with ECDSA
- Status message display functions
- Data fetching functions for wallet balance, transactions, network data, blockchain data, and validator info

#### 2.9 UI Component Conversion

- Implement responsive design using Flutter layout widgets
- Enhance existing Flutter components to match HTML functionality
- Implement missing features that are present in HTML but not in Flutter

#### 2.10 Custom Widget Implementation
Create the following custom widgets to match the HTML design:
- Navigation cards with hover effects and gradient backgrounds
