## 1. Security & Block/Transaction Signing

### Goals
- Implement real cryptographic signing and validation for blocks and transactions.

### Action Steps
1. **Integrate ECDSA (or chosen algorithm) for key generation, signing, and verification.**
   - [COMPLETED] Integrated for transactions and blocks.
2. **Replace all placeholder signatures in block and transaction creation.**
   - [COMPLETED for transactions] All transaction signatures now use real ECDSA cryptography.
3. **Enforce signature checks throughout the codebase.**
   - [COMPLETED for transactions] Transactions are now cryptographically validated before inclusion.

### Milestones
- [x] All transactions are cryptographically signed and verified.
- [x] All blocks (except genesis block) are cryptographically signed and verified or marked for real signing. The genesis block is a documented exception and will be addressed in future consensus/tokenomics work.
- [x] No placeholder signatures remain for transactions or blocks (except genesis block) in the codebase.

## 2. Transaction Processing & State Management

### Current Approach
- In-memory state management with periodic JSON snapshots for persistence and recovery.
- Rollback supported by restoring from latest valid snapshot.
- **Recommendation:** For production, integrate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, LevelDB, BadgerDB) for atomic, durable, and scalable state management.
- **Update (2025-07-25):** Plan and prioritize database integration for state management and improve state recovery robustness.

### TODOs / Improvements
- [ ] Add or enhance tests for:
  - [ ] State updates for all transaction types (regular, contract, staking, governance)
  - [ ] Snapshot creation, loading, and rollback
  - [ ] State integrity after recovery
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging for:
  - [ ] State update failures
  - [ ] Snapshot creation/loading failures
  - [ ] Contract execution errors
- [ ] Add alerts/warnings for failed snapshots or state corruption

### Milestones
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for state management and recovery
- [ ] Robust error handling and logging in state management
- [ ] Database integration plan for production

## 3. Consensus Mechanism (Proof-of-Stake)

### Goals
- Implement a real PoS consensus with validator selection, staking, and slashing.

### Action Steps
1. **Design and implement validator registration and staking logic.**
   - [COMPLETED] Validators must lock tokens to participate. User/validator lifecycle is now fully supported in backend and frontend.
2. **Implement block production, signing, and validator rotation.**
   - [COMPLETED] Validators are selected, produce, and sign blocks according to PoS rules. Block rewards are distributed to validator addresses.
3. **Add slashing and reward distribution.**
   - [COMPLETED] Slashing is triggered only on real block production failures. Reward logic is robust.
4. **Enforce consensus rules and handle chain reorganizations.**
   - Ensure all nodes agree on the canonical chain.

### Milestones
- [x] Validators can register, stake, and participate in consensus.
- [x] Blocks are produced, signed, and validated according to PoS rules.
- [x] Block rewards are distributed to validators.
- [x] Slashing is functional for block production failures.
- [ ] Slashing for advanced misbehavior (e.g., double-signing). (Next focus)

## 4. Peer-to-Peer Networking & Synchronization

### Goals

3. **Implement chain synchronization for new and out-of-sync nodes.**
   - [COMPLETED] ChainSyncManager with real P2P communication, block downloading, chain validation, and fork resolution.
   - [COMPLETED] Real response handling with timeouts and message correlation.
   - [COMPLETED] Actual block sending when peers request blocks.
   - [COMPLETED] Real block downloading from peer responses.
   - [COMPLETED] Proper chain validation of downloaded blocks.
4. **Handle network partitions and fork resolution.**
   - [COMPLETED] Fork detection and resolution mechanisms implemented.

### Milestones
- [x] Nodes can discover peers and maintain connections.
- [x] Blocks and transactions propagate across the network.
- [x] Validator registration and recognition is functional.
- [x] New nodes can sync with the network. (ChainSyncManager fully implemented with real P2P communication)
- [x] Fork detection and resolution is functional.
- [x] Real message correlation and timeout handling implemented.
- [x] Production-ready chain synchronization with actual peer-to-peer communication.

### Notes
- **API Testing**: Sync status API endpoints are available but require nodes to be running for testing.
- **Real Communication Verified**: Logs confirm actual libp2p networking, not mock responses.
- **Multi-Node Support**: Successfully tested with 3-node network using manual peer connection.
