# ðŸš€ **ATLAS Wallet Portal: Agentic Development & Live Environment Management**

*Last Updated: October 17, 2025 | Version: 1.1.0*

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the optimal root directory structure and development strategy for the ATLAS blockchain ecosystem, designed specifically for agentic development and continuous live environment management. The architecture consolidates the cercaend (Flutter app), GOFLUTTER (web interface), and ATLAS.BC0.0.1 (blockchain backend) into a unified, AI-assisted development pipeline capable of autonomous operation and rapid mass delivery.

## Conclusion

This proposal establishes the ATLAS wallet portal as a pioneer in agentic development and autonomous operations. The optimized directory structure, combined with MCP server integration and comprehensive AI assistance, creates a development environment that can evolve autonomously while maintaining human oversight and creativity.
